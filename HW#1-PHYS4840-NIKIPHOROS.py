######### Finishing up the inclass lab from 01/30/25 so QUESTION 0 (All of the functions I wrote can be found in my nikiphoros_function_lib.py file) ############

### EXCERSISE #5 #####

from nikiphoros_functions_lib import niki_sqrt, niki_floor, niki_round, niki_min, niki_argmin

#budget = float(input("How much money do you have: "))

#cookie_change(budget)


### EXCERSISE #6 #####

#x = float(input("What number do you want the sqrt of: "))

#niki_sqrt(x)

###I tested the other functions in my terminal or in the functions file as I did not want to over clutter this file


### EXCERSISE #7 #####

# Pragraph on important Person

# Neumann JÃ¡nos Lajos/John von Neumann (who was born in Budapest, Hungary) was a pioneering figure in computing. 
#He is possibly best known (at least from what I could find) for his development of the von Neumann architecture, 
#which remains the foundation of modern computer design. It says he was a mathematician, physicist, computer 
#scientist and engineer (so he did pretty much everything)! His model introduced the concept of a stored-program 
#computer, where both data and instructions are stored in the same memory. This then allowed for greater flexibility and efficiency. 
#Ultimately this innovation laid the groundwork for the development of general-purpose computers, which 
#in turn influenced everything from early mainframes to present day processors. Outside of pure computing, 
#von Neumann also made significant contributions to fields like game theory, quantum mechanics, and numerical analysis.
#In these other fields von Neumann is credited with playing a key role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, 
#applying his mathematical expertise to complex nuclear physics problems. And His work in game theory led to the creation 
#of the minimax theorem (I am not familiar with this), which remains fundamental in economics and strategic decision-making.
