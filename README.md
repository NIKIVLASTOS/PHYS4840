# PHYS4840
Programs/codes for PHYS4840 -- Spring 2025


nikiphoros_functions_lib.py:
  This is the library of all the function codes I will write over the semester, this will be the place for all functions needed over homeworks, inclass works and any other possible scenario in which I need to make functions.


Feb-4-2025-NIKIPHOROS.py:
  This is my inclass work from February 4th, 2025. It should be notes as well as the plots Dr. Joyce gave us and the 3 plots were were supposed to make (It also imports niki_y, for which I take x values and output y values to then plot).
